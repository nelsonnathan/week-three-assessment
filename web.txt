1. How does the internet work?
    - The internet is a huge network of computers that can communicate with each other. For computers to 
    have the ability to communicate with each other, we connect them via routers (which are 
    another type of computer). A routers purpose is to deliver data from point A to point B
    i.e., one computer to another. To manage the entirety of the worlds computers, a router servicing
    a number of computers must connect to another doing the same. Routers are then connected to modems,
    which translate info from our network of computers into readable info digested by the telephone
    infrastructure. Modems then are connected to an ISP who utilize another kind of router that can 
    communicate with the routers of other ISPs. From there, to communicate with other computers, you need 
    to identify the IP address of the desired destination computer. Any computer connected to a network 
    carries a unique IP address. 



2. What happens when you click on a link?
    -Your browser needs to figure out where you've clicked, by first sorting through your local DNS cache
    to see if the links domain name is held there. If the domain name is not found in the local cache, 
    it will then sort through your local routers DNS. If still not found, the browser checks the ISPs 
    DNS for the domain name. If that comes up empty, the browser will finally consult with the Root
    DNS servers via the internet to locate the domain name. The IP address of that domain name is then
    returned to your browser, where that IP is requested through the web. The request lands you on the 
    links server.
